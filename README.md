# 🎬 BM Player — v1.3.0

A modern, VLC-grade media player powered by **mpv** — gorgeous UI, full audio/video/subtitle control, and a Three.js fox mascot.

---

## What's new in v1.3

**Bug fixes**
- Subtitles no longer clip or double-render — forced ASS override + margin honouring keeps them clear of the controls bar
- Controls bar now auto-hides after 3 seconds of inactivity during playback (VLC-style), and stays visible while paused, hovered, or a side panel is open
- Audio/subtitle track menus do a fresh `get_property` fetch right before opening (both the right-click context menu *and* the new toolbar menus), so tracks are never stale or missing

**VLC-parity controls**
- Full menu bar: Media · Playback · Audio · Video · Subtitle · Tools
- Hardware decoder selection (Auto / NVIDIA nvdec / D3D11VA / DXVA2 / Software)
- 10-band graphic equalizer with presets (Flat, Bass Boost, Treble Boost, Rock, Pop, Jazz, Classical)
- Media Info panel (codec, resolution, fps, bitrate, container, sample rate, channels)
- Playlist panel with add/remove/clear and click-to-play
- Aspect ratio, zoom, deinterlace, audio channel mapping, audio/sub delay, subtitle position & size
- Jump-to-time dialog, chapter navigation, screenshot, loop modes

**Polish**
- Two new themes: Dracula and Northern Lights (Aurora), alongside Dark / Light / Glass
- Fox mascot now tints to match the active theme
- Refined welcome screen with a recent-files grid (click to resume instantly)
- Drag-and-drop anywhere, OSD feedback for every action

## Roadmap status

## Building

```bash
npm ci
npm run gen-icon
npm run build:win64   # or build:win32
```

Requires `mpv.exe` in `vendor/mpv/`. GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) handles this automatically on every `vX.Y.Z` tag push — it downloads mpv, builds both architectures, and publishes a GitHub Release.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "v1.3.0 - VLC-parity controls, bug fixes, two new themes"
git tag v1.3.0
git push origin main --tags
```
